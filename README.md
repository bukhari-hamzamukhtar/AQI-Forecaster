[cite_start]An end-to-end MLOps system that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for the next 72 hours based on the past 7 days of pollutant data[cite: 10]. [cite_start]The system features an automated pipeline for data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and drift monitoring[cite: 7].

## 🔭 Project Overview
Air pollution is a silent killer. [cite_start]This project aims to provide accurate, short-term AQI forecasting to help citizens make informed health decisions[cite: 5]. 

[cite_start]The system fetches hourly pollutant data ($PM_{2.5}$, $PM_{10}$, $NO_2$, $SO_2$, $O_3$, $CO$) from the **Open-Meteo API**[cite: 27], processes it through a robust feature engineering pipeline, and generates forecasts using an ensemble of machine learning models. [cite_start]It was designed to handle **data drift** and operates in a serverless environment using Docker[cite: 8].

## 🏗 System Architecture
The pipeline consists of three main stages:
1. [cite_start]**Data Pipeline:** Automated ingestion and Feature Store (Local Parquet fallback implemented after Hopsworks)[cite: 30, 78].
2. [cite_start]**Training Pipeline:** Comparative evaluation of XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, MLP, and SARIMA[cite: 7].
3. [cite_start]**Inference & Monitoring:** Streamlit dashboard with SHAP explainability and KS-test drift detection[cite: 9, 20].

## ✨ Key Features
* [cite_start]**Multi-Model Evaluation:** compares 5 different architectures (SARIMA proved best for local constraints)[cite: 132].
* [cite_start]**Lazy Model Loading:** Fetches large model artifacts (~8GB) from Hugging Face Hub on runtime to keep Docker images light[cite: 8, 80].
* [cite_start]**Explainable AI:** Integrated **SHAP** and **LIME** to explain *why* a specific AQI was predicted[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Drift Detection:** Monitors production data distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to flag when the model needs retraining[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Reproducibility:** Fully containerized using Docker[cite: 8].

## 📊 Performance
[cite_start]The system was evaluated in two phases: Cloud (Hopsworks) and Local (Resource-Constrained)[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Best Model (Local):** SARIMA [cite: 132]
* [cite_start]**RMSE:** ~24.07 [cite: 180]
* [cite_start]**Accuracy:** >90% on test set validation[cite: 74].

## 💻 How to Run Locally

Since this project deals with large model files and specific dependencies, the easiest way to run it is via Docker.

### Prerequisites
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.
* A **Hugging Face Token** (Read permission) to download the model. [Get one here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

### Method 1: Docker (Recommended)
[cite_start]This ensures you run the exact same environment as the production deployment[cite: 104].

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bukhari-hamzamukhtar/AQI-Forecaster.git](https://github.com/bukhari-hamzamukhtar/AQI-Forecaster.git)
    cd AQI-Forecaster
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t aqi-forecaster .
    ```

3.  **Run the container:**
    *Replace `YOUR_HF_TOKEN` with your actual Hugging Face token.*
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 -e HF_TOKEN="YOUR_HF_TOKEN" aqi-forecaster
    ```

4.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

### Method 2: Manual Python Setup
If you want to edit the code or run without Docker.

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    [cite_start]You need to set the `HF_TOKEN` variable in your terminal so the app can download the model[cite: 112].
    ```bash
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    $env:HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
    
    # Mac/Linux
    export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
    ```

4.  **Run Streamlit:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
